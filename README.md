## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no 
issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using [Milan Airbnb data from 11 december 2019](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) 
to better understand:

1. How does the neighborhood influence the price trend during the year?
2. Are there any peaks in pricing at specific time of the year?
3. What is the trend of reservations during the year? Is there a high season?
4. How has the number of guests increased over the years?
5. It is possible to predict the correct price considering some key features?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the
thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings can be found at the post available [HERE](https://medium.com/@albertocarlone89/an-insight-on-airbnb-in-milan-6fc632d7b14e) and inside the notebook.
